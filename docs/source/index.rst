Introduction
==============

Welcome to the full documentation on the energy tranistion pathway tipping points model.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.

Do you want to get started or link to some further documentation?
This documentation contains details on the user interface, results, calculations and data. See the full documentation :ref:`contents`.
The documentation can be valuable for both users and modellers.

Besides this you can the links underneath to navigate to the source code of both models, and the tool itself.
